# cassandra
A TUI launcher for Aphrodite .yaml files (uses the micromamba runtime).

# Rationale
The Micromamba runtime for Aphrodite is really helpful, but the first time I had to do this nonsense:
`./home/user/AI/text/aphrodite-engine/runtime.sh aphrodite run /home/asriel/AI/text/models/GGUF/lmstudio-community/Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501-Q6_K.gguf --max-model-len 8192 --max-num-seqs 1 --enforce-eager --enable-chunked-prefill --tokenizer-mode mistral --tokenizer mistralai/Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501`
I figured that I was at the point where .yaml configs were going to start making sense. But managing them is still a hassle, and I've been writing a lot of stub scripts and putting them in `~/.local/bin` to smooth the process of launching them, but I still had to pass arguments to Aphrodite to get it to go, so I'd still be writing a bunch by hand, and wouldn't it be nice to have a little mini-launcher to manage my Aphrodite configurations?

....So I made one.

And that's this.

# Instructions

- Ensure `whiptail` is installed (it ought to be in most distros but servers, RunPod and WSL might have to install it)
- (Ideally in your .bashrc or equivalent environment script,) Export `$APHRODITE_ENGINE` to the location of your Aphrodite install. (Defaults to `$HOME/AI/text/aphrodite-engine`; will error if not found.)
- (Ideally in your .bashrc or equivalent environment script,) Export `$APHRODITE_ENGINE_CONFIGS` to the place you want to put your Aphrodite .yaml configs. (Defaults to `$HOME/.cassandra/configs`; will be created if not found.)
- Ensure `runtime.sh` exists in your Aphrodite install; this is generated by the `update_runtime.sh` script.
- Download `cassandra.sh` and run it. If no configs are found in `$APHRODITE_ENGINE_CONFIGS`, it will copy the template provided by Aphrodite. (This will launch Pythia 70M, interestingly enough.)
- Start writing some configs and putting them in `$APHRODITE_ENGINE_CONFIGS`.
- (Optional) Put Cassandra in a directory in `$PATH` (like `~/.local/bin`) so you can launch it easier.
- Exploit the power of Aphrodite Engine to its fullest.
